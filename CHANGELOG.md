##### Changes to DB Schema 

Previously there was only a `bookmarks` table which contained a
few extra column compared to Buku. This table is renamed to
`gskbookmarks` which will be the native gosuki table schema. 

Instead we provide a `bookmarks` view into `gskbookmarks` with
INSERT and UPDATE trigger (INSTEAD OF) that allow Buku programs to
use Gosuki DB as a buku database while still benifiting from
gosuki specific features that will eventually be added to the
schema.

Added also schema versioning that will be tracked in the table
creatively named `schema_version`.
